- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Chau Giang
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in dust physics and the interaction between radiation field and magnetic field with dust grains. I am currently develop the tool POLARIS+ - the 3D Radiative Transfer code that use to model the dust polarization by dust alignment by RATs, for modeling the detailed of dust alignment, dust disruption by RAdiative Torque and study how it constrains the starlight and thermal dust emission behavior. My project now focuses on the dense region as molecular cloud and protoplanetary disk where dust is shield from radiation and strongly coupling with the dense gas, the detailed physics of dust alignment should be addressed here. I hope that the detailed modeling will shed the light for analysing the observational data more better and extracting again the physics and activities of dust in all regions in space.
