- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Chau Giang
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in dust physics and the interaction between radiation field and magnetic field with dust grains. Specifically, how radiation field constrains the dust properties, distribution, structure and how dust controls the extinction, polarization of stellar radiation as well as the contribution of thermal dust emission on the observed SED; how dust and magnetic field coupling together, and how these interactions control the polarimetry properties of studied object, i.e., multi-wavelength polarized SED, polarization vector, how dust traces the magnetic field geometry, magnitude and how to use observation to extract dust physics, etc.
- 
- I am currently develop the 3D Radiative Transfer code POLARIS for modeling the dust alignment, dust disruption by RAdiative Torque and study how it constrains the starlight and thermal dust emission behavior. My project now focuses on the dense region as molecular cloud and protoplanetary disk where dust is shield from radiation and strongly coupling with the dense gas, such that the detailed physics of dust alignment should be addressed here. I hope that the detailed modeling will shed the light for analysing the observational data more better and studying the physics and activities of dust in all regions in space.
